 Menu Driven Application for booking movie tickets
 Flowchart of How the program works.

 Phase 1: Splash Screen -> Asks for Choice of movie -> Appends it to filename -> Prints the avaliable seats for the given movie.

 Phase 2: Gets the desired number of seats and uses a loop to load the indexes into a 2D array.As it loads it checks if the data is appropriate.

 Phase 3:Checks if user is a member with a yes or no choice and then takes username and passoword input into a structure. loops if invalid input.

 Phase 4: If member confirmed a lower price is offered and a phone number is taken as input and a random number is generated as an OTP which can be found int OTP.txt.

 Phase 5: Once OTP confirmed, the values from the 2D arrays are loaded into 1D arrays and each index is replaced with an X.

 Phase 6: A Booking ID is generated randomly and given to the user. A prompt is then given incase they want to see a picture of the floor layout of blockplex.
